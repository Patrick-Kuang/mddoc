@(统计笔记)[生存分析]
#再次澄清几个生存的概念
之前没有搞清楚的概念，今天开了一篇blood的文章，算是在方法学里头把这个问题讲得比较清楚了。

> #### Response and outcome definitions
**CR** was defined as the presence of < 5% blasts in the BM with > 1 x 109/L neutrophils and >100 x 109/L platelets in the PB with no extramedullary disease. **Relapse** was defined by recurrence of > 5% blasts in a BM aspirate unrelated to recovery or by the presence of extramedullary disease. **CR duration (CRD)** was calculated from the time of CR until relapse. **Disease-free survival (DFS)** was calculated from the time of CR until relapse or death from any cause. **Event-free survival (EFS)** was calculated from the beginning of treatment until an event including relapse, death during induction, or death in CR. **Overall survival (OS)** was calculated from the time of initiation of treatment until death.

再看统计方法的描述
> #### Statistical methods
Patient characteristics were summarized using the median (range) for numerical variables and frequencies (percentages) for categorical variables. Associations between categorical variables were assessed using Fisher exact tests. The Kaplan and Meier method was used to estimate the hazard functions of OS and DFS, and the 2-sided log-rank test was used to compare the hazard functions between groups. EFS was defined as time to disease relapse or death, whichever came first. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards models were used to assess the EFS by MMR, IGH, and MFC as timedependent variables, respectively, adjusting for other baseline covariates. The cumulative incidence of relapse was estimated using competing risk analysis for death and relapse.

> **Cumulative incidence of relapse (CIR)** was calculated from day 85 to relapse or date of last follow-up for patients alive in first CHR, using the cumulative incidence method and considering death in CHR as competing risk. ([see Gooley TA, 1991](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10204198/))
